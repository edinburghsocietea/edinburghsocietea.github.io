Dear Tea Lovers,

We hope you've all been enjoying our teas so far! We know it can be hard to keep track of which ones we have tried... so we will be posting here a record of the teas we taste each week, to help you remember any particular favourites. I've tried to include where we got the teas from as well, so that once we get the membership cards sorted out you can go out and use your discount to buy them, if you fancy!

Our Freshers Week events were extremely popular this year... we are very sorry if we had to turn you away from any! Our biggest event was the Freshers Tasting held in the Teviot Dining Room, where we held a semi-blind tasting where you had to work out which tea you were drinking from a list of descriptions... for the record, these were the teas we tried:

* Tea 1 - Orange Blossom Oolong (Pekoe Tea)
* Tea 2 - Tarry Souchong (Anteaques)
* Tea 3 - Jade Pyramids (Better Beverage Company)
* Tea 4 - Blue Lady (Anteaques)
* Tea 5 - Lavender Rooibos (Pekoe Tea)

Congratulations to the winning table, who got the closest to this list! We hope you enjoyed your cake and tea prizes.

Don't forget our weekly meetings in Room 1 of the Chaplaincy, every Thursday from 5.30pm.
