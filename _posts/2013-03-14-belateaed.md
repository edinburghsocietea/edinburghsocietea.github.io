Hello Tea Lovers,

Apologies that there has not been an updaTEA in such a long time! Several weeks to catch you up on.

### 14/2/13 - Valentine's Tea!

Quieter than usual this week (lots of dates? and you didn't want to bring them to tea?!), but those of you who came enjoyed a special treat, as Amy brought in some flowering teas.

We tried the aptly-named 'Dancing Lovers' tea, which the packet describes as containing silver needle, jasmine, globe amaranth, and vanilla.

We also had Blackberry Tea (Anteaques), Shui Xian (that lovely oolong from Pekoe Tea) and some lovely brownies Amy made.

### 21/2/13

Milky Oolong (Better Beverage Company)
Orange Blossom Oolong (Pekoe Tea)
Sencha (Anteaques)
Liquorice Rooibos (Anteaques)

### 07/3/13

Redcurrant Green (Anteaques)
Chocolate Tea (Pekoe Tea)
Grapefruit Black Tea (Anteaques)
Chamomile (Anteaques)

Don't forget that this week **Thursday 14th March** is our **AGM** for voting on next year's commiTEA!

Reigning El PresidenTEA Amy has promised as an extra incentive (as if you need any!) "more cake than usual and free tea samples for everyone from our 'library' of tea"!!

So no excuses, see you 5.30 in Chaplaincy Room 1.
