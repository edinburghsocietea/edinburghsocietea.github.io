...and good old Tunnocks TEAcakes (Tunnocks are vegetarian for those who weren't sure! Just don't buy the Lees ones, as they contain gelatine)

If you would like to try out Prue's delicious earl grey shortbread cookie recipe, check out this link! http://www.bostontea.com/index.cfm/teadesserts.html
For those interested in trying further recipes with tea, this website has quite a few, including cocktails!

Hopefully I will add the other recipes as and when I get them in.

Happy tea-drinking/baking!

See you next week!
