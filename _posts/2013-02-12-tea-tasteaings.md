Dear Tea Lovers,

A few tasTEA tea tasTEAings to catch you up on! (too much?)

First of all 31/1/13

Originally Jon from PekoeTea was going to come along to talk to us at our normal SocieTea event, but after he had to cancel, he invited us down to PekoeTea itself to do a special tasting with the lovely Magda.

We tried some GREAT teas! They were as follows...

Moonlight White (white tea)
Xin Yang Mao Jian (green tea)
Raw Loose Jing Mai Ancient Trees (pu erh)
Shui Xian (oolong)

We were particularly enamoured of the final tea, and bought some for the SocieTea stocks... so don't worry if you missed out! We will definitely be trying it soon!

They had this really cool wooden board they made the tea on that drained all the excess water away (which was useful, as they poured hot water and tea all over the clay teapot - inside and outside. And all over the frog. Don't ask.)

Freshly-watered teapot ...  and frog!

Back at normal SocieTea we had an Anteaques-y theme:

Verbena (Anteaques)
Dimbula Ceylon (Anteaques)
Castleton (Anteaques)

7/2/13 Eteaket Tasting!

Thank you to the 13 of you who walked over to Eteaket for a tasting there. After an AA-themed opening, we tried tiny bits of 12 teas, which were...

Awesome Assam, Bouteaque Blue Mist, Lapsang Souchong, Yellow Gold Oolong, Gunpowder Deluxe, Genmaicha, Gyokuro, White Peony, Silver Needle, Blooming Marvellous, Bollywood Dreams Chai, and Spicy Chilli Rooibos.

A lovely selection of teas even if the actual tasting was somewhat unorthodox. I assume you all did well at the semi-blind tasting! Our table got them all right at least :) We also got 20% off teas after attending the tasting. Since so many of you stayed to buy tea I assume you all managed to find things you liked, we hope you enjoyed yourselves!!

Join us on Thursday for more tea. Ooh, its Valentine's day.
