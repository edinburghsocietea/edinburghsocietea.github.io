So, last week was the fabulous TEAbet event, where we joined up with Tibet Soc to combine Tibetan-themed tea and food with information on Tibetan culture and politics.

We had quite the spread! Lots of snacks, including Tibetan favourites Momos (steamed dumplings, we had them filled with vegetables), some rather delicious walnut and pomegranate bread, and cheese, crackers and biscuits!

Tea-wise this week, we wanted to bring you something different... and so we went for the famous TIBETAN BUTTER TEA. We know you want to see pictures of this getting made...

Yes, that is butter, and then milk and salt, being added to a huge pot of brick tea (we used pu-erh). Traditionally it is made with nak (female of the yak species!) butter and milk, giving it a more pungent taste, so try this at home if you like! Although we've heard this is a very acquired taste!

It was quite a different tea for us to try (as you know, normally it is no milk allowed!), please let us know what you think! Some of you had seconds (including me), so it couldn't have been all bad... We did however brew another tea - Jasmine Yin Hao green tea from PekoeTea - in anticipation that it may not be to everyone's tastes.
