Hey Tea Lovers,

Wee update on what we've been drinking in the last two sessions...

21/03/13

Margarita Assam (Anteaques)
Lapsang Souchong (Anteaques)
Blackberry (Anteaques)

There was a lot of hilariTEA this week (I know we are funny, but laughing under tables?!). Perhaps this was the caffeine hit, as we went for all black teas and no infusions!

28/03/13

Today we tried teas brought back from Belgrade by returning El PresidenTEA Amy...

TEA FOR LOVERS - black tea blend with apple, cinnamon, ginger, almond and vanilla.
TEA FOR DESSERT - green tea with rose petals, mango, yellow peach and 'citrus fruit aroma'.

This week also saw the addition of 'classical' music. Just when you thought we couldn't get any more cultured.

See yous next week for more tea-related fun.
