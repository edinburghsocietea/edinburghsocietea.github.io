Hey there Tea Lovers!

A belaTEAd update on what we've been drinking in the last two sessions...

### 18/10/12

This week was a bit different, you got to sample some of Anteaques' seasonal offerings. These are only available for a limiTEAd time, and the ones we tried were Lavender Green, Blackberry, and Grapefruit Black Tea.

They're not part of the normal Anteaques stock and you won't find them online, so if you fancy having more of any of them I would get down to Anteaques pretty soon! Although I'm sure we will taste them again at some point during our weekly meeTEAings, especially if you let us know you liked them!

This week we tried...

Marybong (Anteaques)
Wijaya Estate (Monsoon Mountains)
Chocolate Tea (Pekoe Tea)
Milky Oolong (Better Beverage Company)

There was not a lot of love for the chocolate tea... some of you felt it didn't taste sufficiently chocolatey, although some still enjoyed it! Anteaques also do various chocolate teas, which have been popular in the past, so it would be interesting to see if you prefer them.

In any case, hopefully the Milky Oolong, which was voted SocieTEA favourite tea last year (much to our previous president's disgust), made up for it. Word is it tastes like popcorn...

Come drink tea with us again tomorrow to keep warm,
