Hey there Tea Lovers!

Another wee update...

### 22/11/12

This week we had a presentation from TEACHAfrica about a project to build schools in Ghana over the summer.

To keep with the theme we tried two African teas:

Rooibos (Anteaques)
Rwandan Black Tea (Better Beverage Company)

N.B. for those interesting in the Ghana project: sign-up (with deposit)  is now live, so don't leave it too long to do so if you want to go!!

Tea tasting with Dave from Better Beverage Company!

I think you'll all agree we learnt some pretty interesting stuff about the origins of tea, tea production, and tea marketing... As well as some interesting ways to drink tea, including with irn bru... I'm not sure he was recommending this, but it seemed like a good idea to me!

First of all we tried a black gem tea, and a flowering white tea. Then we tried two white teas, one very expensive and one sold at an average price... Dave is very interested to know which you preferred, so do get back to us and let us know!!

Saara, our treasurer, also made some delicious cinnamon rolls:

You may have noticed that Dave is quite the showman... so it will come us no surprise that he is into amateur dramatics! Some of CommiTEA went to see a play he directed and performed in at the end of November... Curtain up on Murder!

Here we are enjoying the half time tea and biscuits (and displaying the very funny programme)

Later that night, things get a bit lairy...

Don't feel left out, you were all invited! Incidentally, if you would like more non-strictly-tea-related events, do let us know. A tea-shop to pub-crawl has been suggested. And TEAquila. Just sayin'.

Anyway, we hope you enjoyed Dave's tasting, don't forget to visit his shop on Morrison Street (it might look closed, but its not!), we don't get discount there, but that's because his tea (and coffee) is so cheap already!
