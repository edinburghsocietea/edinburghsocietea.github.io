Dear Tea Lovers,

We had an eventful session last week (14/3/13), as we elected the new commiTEA for 2013/14. We also had a truly glorious amount of CAKE...

Yes folks, that is real clotted cream! And real lime/lime tea goo-cakes!

We had Lime Black Tea (to accompany our lime and lime tea cakes, how civilized) and Bancha Houjicha (which is roasted instead of steamed, I'm sure this means a lot to all of you), both of which Amy bought when she was in Oxford recently, from the teashop Cardews of Oxford.

We also had Rooibos from Anteaques.

We also had CAKE.

A rather excellent cake-to-person ratio there. Although more people did turn up, and then after some standard ninja-chat, we got down to BUSINESS.

So, your 2013/14 CommiTEA are...

El PresidenTEA: Amy Guy
SecreTEAry: Charlotte Lilley
TEAsurer: Albert Lo
Vice PresidenTEA: Alice Hailwood
TEA Historian:  Alex Kearney
Ordinary Member: Matus Falis (sorry, blogger doesn't let me use special characters to write your name properly!)

Thanks go to Amy, for making most of the cakes as usual, and  Charlotte, for bringing some lovely cakes from Tea at 94. Could this have been a feature in their re-election?! ;)

Next tea session is tomorrow, usual time and place. I will just leave you now with some more CAKE.
