Tea Lovers!

We return for 2013, with more teas to try.

AND a tea-related board game. Barons of Tea! We do love anything tea-related...

Look how pretty it is! And how happy we look playing it! There are a lot of rules, but we are getting the hang of it... watch out for sea monsters!

Teas we tried on 17/01/13 while enjoying the game -

Blackberry (Anteaques - limited edition)
Pink Lady (Anteaques)
A nice black tea... we can't remember which now, and I don't want to lie to you...

I'll distract you by showing images of the delicious chocolate and cherry cakes Amy made for us instead -
