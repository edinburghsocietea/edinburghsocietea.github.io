## Hey, tea lover

At the University of Edinburgh Tea Society, civilised gatherings are our speciality.  Whether you're a tea connoisseur or just like a good cuppa, you're welcome to join us for a drink and casual chat.

We enjoy high quality teas and infusions from around the world, provided locally by Edinburgh tea shops as well as gathered by our members on their travels.  We try to impart knowledge about their origins and how they were produced as much as possible.  If you choose to join our ranks, you'll have access to our extensive 'library' of teas free of charge.

### Don't like tea?

You can't have tried them all.  We drink black, green, white, yellow and flavoured tea, rooibos and herbal infusions.  Challenge us to find something you like.
                        
### Membership

Membership is just £5 for the whole academic year, although you're never obliged to join.  Members will be issued with cards which give a discount at a number of fantastic Edinburgh tea shops though, as well as free or discounted access to our special events.  After October, Weekly MeeTeaings are &pound;1 per week for non-members.

You can pay for membership in person at any of our events, or <a href="http://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/societies/society/SocieTea/">on the EUSA website</a>.</p>
